                <img src="images/magic1.webp" alt="Arcane vs Divine Magic">
                <p>Magic in Dungeons & Dragons is divided into two primary sources: arcane and divine. Arcane magic, wielded by wizards, sorcerers, and warlocks, is drawn from raw magical energy and requires study or innate power. Wizards learn magic through rigorous training, recording spells in their spellbooks, while sorcerers channel it through inherited power. Warlocks, on the other hand, gain their magic through pacts with powerful entities. Divine magic, used by clerics and paladins, is granted by deities and higher beings. These spellcasters use their faith to channel divine energy, healing allies and smiting foes. Both forms of magic shape the world of D&D, influencing combat, exploration, and storytelling.</p>

                <h2 class="heading_style">2. The Schools of Magic</h2>
                <img src="images/magic2.jpg" alt="Schools of Magic">
                <p>Magic in D&D is further categorized into eight schools, each representing different aspects of spellcasting. Abjuration focuses on protection, creating barriers and dispelling harmful effects. Conjuration allows casters to summon creatures or objects from thin air. Divination grants knowledge by revealing hidden truths and glimpses of the future. Enchantment influences the minds of others, charming or controlling their actions. Evocation is the school of raw destructive power, enabling casters to hurl fireballs and lightning bolts. Illusion alters perception, creating false images or invisibility. Necromancy manipulates life and death, allowing casters to raise undead minions or drain vitality. Transmutation changes matter, granting abilities like flight or stone-hard skin. Each school offers unique advantages, shaping the way magic is used in gameplay.</p>

                <h3 class="aside_title">Notable Magical Classes</h3>
                <p>Different classes utilize magic in unique ways, defining their playstyle and role in a party. Wizards master an extensive list of spells, preparing them daily based on their needs. Sorcerers rely on raw magical talent, using sorcery points to modify their spells in creative ways. Warlocks, with limited spell slots, excel at casting high-powered spells frequently through Eldritch Invocations. Clerics and Druids channel divine power for healing and support, while Bards use their magic to inspire allies and manipulate fate.</p>
